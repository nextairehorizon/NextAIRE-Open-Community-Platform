# Open-Community-Platform

The open community platform establishes a community platform within a Git repository. The goal of the platform is to encourage contributions from outside the consortium and facilitate the life-long learning sustainability of R&I Trained Talents during their carrier pathways. This repository facilitates the exchange of ideas, models and code improvements and promotes the continuous improvement of AI and data management tools through community contributions of both R&I Target Talents and external communities.
